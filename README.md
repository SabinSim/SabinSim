## 📍 About Me
I am a Computer Engineering student based in **Cazis, Switzerland**. **I build reliable backend systems by focusing on execution flow, predictable state transitions, and structural clarity.** Transitioning from Python-based backend development, I am currently dedicating myself to the **C# and .NET ecosystem** alongside **Azure Cloud Infrastructure**.

I believe real engineering begins when you understand *why* a system behaves the way it does. I focus on understanding execution flow, call stack behavior, and state transitions before moving to higher-level frameworks.

## 📜 Certifications & Cloud Journey
* 🏅 **Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)** – *Achieved*
* 🎯 **Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)** – *In Progress*

---

## 📌 Active Engineering: Core Fundamentals
I build structured console applications to translate my architectural thinking into concrete C# code.

* 🔗 **[Featured Repository: CSharp-Mini-Projects](https://github.com/SabinSim/CSharp-Mini-Projects)** — *C# Flow Practice (Input Validation & Control Flow Patterns)*
  * **Input Validation Loops:** Implementing robust, error-proof patterns using `TryParse` and `out` parameters.
  * **Control-Flow Driven State:** Designing predictable state transitions using `while`, `do-while`, and structured control flow.
  * **Clean Method Separation:** Designing methods with clear responsibilities, tracing return values, and utilizing 'Early Return' patterns.

---

## 🧩 Development Philosophy
* **1️⃣ Flow First:** *I avoid writing code I cannot mentally simulate.* I focus on understanding the complete lifecycle of a request: `Input → Validation → Processing → Return → Output`.
* **2️⃣ Structure Over Syntax:** I strive to deeply understand the "Why" (e.g., *Why is static required here? What does return actually do to the call stack?*).
* **3️⃣ Clean Code Thinking:** Clear naming conventions, strict separation of responsibilities, and reusable logic.

---

## 🚀 Mid to Long-Term Vision
* **Mid-Term:** **Building ASP.NET Core Web APIs with proper separation of concerns and testable architecture.**
* **Long-Term Vision:** Designing secure backend systems for financial/medical domains, implementing Clean Architecture in enterprise environments, and automating Cloud infrastructure deployment via Azure.
