## 💻 Tech Stack & Current Focus

I am currently concentrating on becoming a proficient Full-Stack Developer, primarily guided by the curriculum recommended by Google Gemini.

### 📚 Core Learning Stacks

| Category | Technology Stacks |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Python (Django/Flask), Java (Learned through university coursework) |
| **Frontend** | JavaScript (Planning to learn React/Vue and related libraries) |
| **Databases** | SQL / NoSQL (Next step in the learning curriculum) |
| **Fundamentals** | C (University Coursework), Data Structures and Algorithms |


## 💡 What I'm currently focused on

* **Career Goal:** Successfully transitioning into a Full-Stack Developer role in Switzerland or a global environment.
* **Projects:** [Briefly mention the name or idea of a project you are currently working on here]
* **Next Step in Curriculum:** [Mention the next topic you are about to study (e.g., Building a SPA with React)]

## 🔨 Current Projects I'm Building

These are the core projects and applications I am actively working on, utilizing key concepts from my full-stack curriculum:

* **🐍 Python CLI Quiz Master (In Progress)**
    — A command-line application focusing on interactive quizzes. This project emphasizes **clean function design**, **input validation**, and managing **data structures (lists/dictionaries)** to handle question sets.
* **☕️ OOP Vending Machine Simulator (Planning Phase)**
    — Currently in the design phase. This console application will simulate a simple machine, built to master **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and robust **error handling**.
* **🛡️ Text-Based Combat System (Advanced OOP)**
    — A turn-based combat game built in Python. This project is dedicated to mastering **advanced OOP concepts** like inheritance and polymorphism, and exploring libraries for enhanced CLI output.

*I am continuously pushing updates and starting new experiments as I progress through my learning path.*

## 🚀 My Approach

As a Computer Engineering student and aspiring Full-Stack Developer, my approach is centered on efficiency, depth, and tangible results:

1.  **Project-Driven Learning (PDL):** I prioritize hands-on practice. Every new concept or technology I learn is immediately applied in a small experiment or integrated into a feature of a larger project.
2.  **Clean Code & Fundamentals:** I strive to write maintainable, well-documented code, emphasizing core software engineering principles, algorithms, and data structures before diving into frameworks.
3.  **Growth Mindset & Ownership:** I actively seek out challenging problems and new technologies (like the curriculum provided by Gemini) and take full ownership of the learning process, documenting my failures and successes.

## 📬 Let's Connect!
