## ⚡ Developer Philosophy

1.  **Documentation:** I believe code is read more often than it is written. I maintain clear commit logs and documentation.
2.  **Why over How:** I strive to understand the architectural reasons behind code, not just the syntax.
3.  **Adaptability:** Transitioning from Python to C# demonstrates my ability to learn new technologies quickly to meet business needs.
